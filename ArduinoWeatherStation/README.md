Arduino code for the weather stations. Needs cleanup.

Git hash is stored in revid.h. This file is automatically generated by gitver.cmd or gitver.sh.

To make the arduino IDE automatically run this script on build, alter platform.txt and add:
recipe.hooks.prebuild.0.pattern="{build.source.path}/gitver.cmd"
(A gitver.sh has been inlcuded for Linux, but it's untested.)
