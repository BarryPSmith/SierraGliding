        These environment variables are used to control several features of
        the System.Data.SQLite library.  All of these environment variables
        are optional.  If a particular environment variable is not present,
        the XML configuration file &quot;System.Data.SQLite.dll.config&quot;
        in the directory containing the currently executing assembly (i.e.
        the one containing all the managed components for System.Data.SQLite)
        will also be consulted.  If present, the XML configuration file should
        be structured as follows:
        <pre>
        &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
        &lt;configuration&gt;
          &lt;appSettings&gt;
            &lt;add key=&quot;A_Setting&quot; value=&quot;String Value&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;add key=&quot;Another_Setting&quot; value=&quot;%ENV_VALUE%&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;/appSettings&gt;
        &lt;/configuration&gt;
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        All references to existing environment variables will be expanded to
        their corresponding values within the returned settings values unless
        either the &quot;No_Expand&quot; or &quot;No_Expand_&lt;name&gt;&quot;
        environment variable is set [to anything].

          None of these environment variables are supported by the Compact
          Framework builds of System.Data.SQLite, due to limitations imposed
          by the platform itself; however, the XML configuration file mentioned
          above may be used instead.
